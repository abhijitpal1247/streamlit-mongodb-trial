# streamlit-mongodb-trial
Just trying out docker, mongodb and streamlit. A sample project.

There is a login, sign up and logout functionality implemented here. With this app you can login, upload an image dataset, save the dataset to the database and can view a preview of the datasets (which have been saved).
